# React Flow Node Graph
This project is a simple React application that implements a node graph using React Flow, React Redux libraries. Users can create new nodes, connect them using branches and delete them by clicking the X icon that appears on mouse over.

## Features

**Create Node**
- The Home page contains a 'Create node' button on the left side. Upon clicking on it, a node in a circle/rectangle shape will get created on the graph panel.

**Connect Nodes**
- Users can connect two nodes using a branch. To do this, they can click and drag from the output port of one node to the input port of another node.

**Delete Nodes**
- On mouseover to a node, an 'X' icon in red color appears. Upon clicking that icon, the node will get deleted. Similarly, the user can also delete branches by clicking on the 'X' icon that appears on mouseover.

**Video Recording**
- A video recording of creating nodes, adding branches, deleting nodes and deleting branches can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/8ATW4FjtfoU).
